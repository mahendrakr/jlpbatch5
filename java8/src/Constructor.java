/**  
 * Difference between method and constructor
 * technical:
 * constructor name must be exactly class name but method name could be any logical name
 * constructor does not have return type even void but method must have return type
 * example:
 *   class Rat{
 *    Rat(){} //this is constructor
 *    void Rat(){} //this is method
 * }
